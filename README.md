# Soft Landing Simulation

A MATLAB-based simulation environment for modeling and analyzing the soft landing of lunar landers. This project is crafted for students, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in space exploration, physics, and engineering. The simulation is built entirely from first principles, leveraging Newton's laws of motion to provide an accurate and insightful learning tool.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Physics-Based:** All calculations and dynamics are derived directly from Newton's laws—no black boxes, only transparent, educational modeling.
- **Lunar-Focused:** Simulates the unique challenges of landing on the Moon, including reduced gravity and no atmospheric drag.
- **Educational:** Designed for students and researchers interested in planetary landings, space robotics, and physics.
- **MATLAB Implementation:** Clean, well-commented code for easy customization and experimentation.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (R2024b or newer recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jeevesh21Pandey/soft-landing-simulation.git
    cd soft-landing-simulation
    ```
2. Open MATLAB and set the folder as the current directory.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Open the main simulation script (e.g., `main.m`) in MATLAB.
2. Adjust parameters such as initial height, mass, thrust, and gravity as needed.
3. Run the script:
    ```matlab
    main
    ```
4. View plots and analyze results to understand the dynamics of lunar landings.
